# ttl-changer
A program to bypass restrictions on Internet sharing from a mobile device
## Description
Often, checking whether traffic is being shared is done by examining the TTL. The standard TTL for a phone is 64, and for a computer, it is 128. When passing through the phoneâ€™s network share, the TTL value decreases by one. To disguise computer traffic as a phone, you need to set the TTL to 65. This can be done using the ```sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_default_ttl=65``` command. The entire project could fit into 2 lines of a bash script, but unfortunately, interpreted scripts cannot be used with the set-user-id privilege. Therefore, to ensure the script does not require sudo when running, a compiled programming language is used.
